# Project #1: Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe game is if the player got three 'X' or 'O' in the same row then he is the winner.

# Game Logic JS
I wrote a function called win. This fuction check all the conditions and see if the player has one of the condition is true then he is the winner. If all the condition is false then it's a tie.
Also there is a function called resest so if the players want to play another game then they press the buuton and the button call the function then the game reset except the score.

# What I learned 
I learned a lot of new information in html,css and JS. Also, I learned dom and jquery.This project was really fun I enjoyed every part of it it was challenging.
